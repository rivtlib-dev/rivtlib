rivtlib
========

rivt is an open source software project that simplifies sharing and reuse of
engineering documents. This has always been a challenge because engineering
documents are complex. They include text, images, tables, calculations, models
and computer code organized into reports.

The primary use case for rivt is producing engineering documents that lie
somewhere between back of envelope notes and calculations, and formal journal
publications. In other words, it produces formatted, organized documents that
are easy to edit.

The second use case is when flexibilty is needed to produce documents in a
variety of formats including text, PDF or HTML.


A *rivt file* publishes a formatted *rivt doc* as a text, PDF or HTML file. A
*rivt file* is a Python file (.py) that imports the *rivtlib* Python package and
includes rivt markup. A collection of *rivt docs* may be linked and collated as
a *rivt report*. The rivt user manual is `here <https://rivt.info>`__.

rivt files can function as a front and back end for:

#. software control
#. visualization
#. instrumentation

rivt docs can be used for:

#. internal communication
#. research documentation
#. government permits
#. technical reports
#. funding applications

Because rivt is compatible with collaborative tools it may be used in:

#. teaching
#. for presentations
#. real time collaboration
